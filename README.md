A bar graph depicts the forgeign exchange rates with currency conversion.

The rates are quoted against the default base currency, USD (US dollar), by setting the parameter:
https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=USD. The base currency can be changed using the 'select' box in the application.

The followoing countries are compared by setting the symbols parameter:
https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?symbols=USD,EUR,AUD,GBP,BRL

If the user clicks on a bar in the graph, an alert box displays instructions to change the base currency.
